Copalan is an AI-assisted knowledge platform designed to curate and improve your organisation's internal knowledge base, regardless of where that knowledge lives. We connect to various third-party platforms—GitHub, Atlassian Confluence, Google Drive, Slack, and Jira—to index, analyse, and enhance documentation quality using AI.

Our mission is to help organisations maintain high-quality curated documentation by automatically identifying gaps, monitoring support conversations, generating actionable recommendations and always keeping human contributors in the loop for regular reviews. We believe that good documentation is the foundation of effective teams, and we're building the tools to make maintaining it effortless.
